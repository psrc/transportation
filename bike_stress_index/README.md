Bike stress index for PSRC based on [Lowry et al (2016)](https://www1.coe.neu.edu/~pfurth/Furth%20papers/2016%20Prioritizing%20to%20improve%20low-stress%20network%20connectivity%20Lowry,%20Furth,%20Hadden-Loh.pdf)

[bike_stress_notebook_shapefile](https://github.com/psrc/transportation/blob/main/bike_stress_index/bike_stress_notebook_shapefile.ipynb) was used to generate bike stress based on facility type, number of lanes, speed limit, and slope. The primary input is a shapefile of network attributes generated by Nick (which should also include slope). The file bike_stress_table.csv contains the weights to be applied to roadway links based on attributes. 

This repository also contains WSDOT methods, which can be used to calcualte an alternative bike stress methodology or pedestrian stress (which Lowry does not consider). The downside of these approaches is that they do not include slope for biking and they rely on volume data, which is not always available for facilities smaller than arterial.
